# DataDash Wallet

DataDash wallet using an ERC-20 smat changing code that actually uses this method. Now we are doing HTTP requests to get the book, tomorrow backend can say "Hey, now we use Protobuf api instead of http api", in a week we will store the books locally and we will change the method implementation again, but not the signature, so we don't need to change the methods which actually use this getBook method, we will need to only change data layer, not others domain or presentation layer.
colors come from defination of designer's Figma. The logic part is to call the related APIs.
